Insertion sort:
  Quick for small array's.

Bubble sort:
  Quite some overhead. Issues with small numbers at the end of the array (turtles), because it has to start over again every time, until the turtle is at the right place.

Cocktail sort:
  Like bubble sort, but once one iteration is done, it will start at the end, and vice versa.
  More than twice as fast as bubble sort.

Comb sort:
  Starts with comparing two elements with a large gap, and over every iteration the gap wil get smaller, until the gap is 1 (so it will become a bubble sort).

Shell sort:
  Same like comb sort, but it doesn't divide the length of the array by 1.3, 1.3^2 etc, but it uses fixed gaps: 1,4,10,23,57,132,301,701 or something similar.
